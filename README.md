# ml-segmentation-2
This side project builds on my previous work in machine learning-based image segmentation. The current focus is on enhancing software quality and user experience. It serves as a practical environment to improve and deepen my software engineering skills.

Changes include codebase improvement, automated unit testing, modernizing the UI and adding some features missing in the previous project.
